# aero-tools
These are some modular pieces of code written in classes that contain useful tools for handling common problems in Aerospace. We were taught in school to just put functions in a new file and make sure they're in the same folder as the code you're working on, but classes allow for imports and multiple instances of the same function which helps to retain data and keep stuff tidy.

Here is a useful starter on how to create an instance of a class in Matlab: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/create-a-simple-class.html

Enjoy! And please give any feedback, what I should write next, or let me know any mistakes I've made with the maths. Next up is probably some orbits or dynamics, once I move them from their unenlightened functions.
